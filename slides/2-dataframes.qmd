## Introductions

## ICA and Homework review

# R Projects (.RProj files)

## R Projects

-   A file (**`.RProj`**) which lives in the root of a project directory
-   RStudio uses this file to:
    -   set working directory
    -   remember command history (console + History pane)
    -   remember project-specific option settings (Tools menu)
-   It's recommended to create an RProject for each of your projects that use RStudio, to help keep your work organized.
-   File \> New Project...

# The pipe operator

## Pipe operator, `%>%` {.smaller}

-   A tidyverse feature (magrittr package)
-   Written as: **`%>%`** (percent greater-than percent)
-   `exprA %>% exprB` evaluates expression A, and then sends its output to expression B as input

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
my_values <- c(1.33, 1.66, 2.33)

mean(my_values) %>% round(1)

# is the same as:

round(mean(my_values), 1)
```

Note that the first argument of `round()` has disappeared in the piped version, because it is filled by the mean just calculated. `1` is the `digits` argument, i.e., one decimal place.

## Pipelines

We can string together as many piped expressions as we want. For example, this code calculates temperature changes from three experimental trials, averages and rounds them, then prints a short statement:

```{r}
#| echo: true
t_initial <- c(25.04, 24.88, 25.23)
t_final <- c(35.82, 35.88, 35.67)

(t_final - t_initial) %>% 
  mean() %>% 
  signif(4) %>% 
  paste("°C avg. ΔT")
```

## Pipeline object assignment

Like other expressions, a pipeline can have its result assigned to an object.

Revising the same example: the value is calculated and assigned in its own pipe (as `delta_t_avg`), then combined with text afterwards.

```{r}
#| echo: true
delta_t_avg <- (t_final - t_initial) %>% 
  mean() %>% 
  signif(4)

paste(delta_t_avg, "°C avg. ΔT")
```

## Benefits of the pipe

1.  Avoid function wrapping (which is hard to read)
2.  Avoid storing too many intermediate results in the environment (using object assignment)
3.  The pipeline is easy to read as a procedure
4.  Pipelines are easy to modify, e.g., to add new intermediate calls, or to cut them short when a problem has appeared.

## Keyboard shortcuts revisited {.smaller}

# Selecting and ordering df variables

## Step 0: load data

```{r}
#| echo: true
polyps <- read_csv("data/polyps.csv")
names(polyps)
```

## Selecting variables (columns) with `dplyr::select()` {.smaller}

-   We often only want a small number of the data frame's variables when investigating or visualizing a question
-   `select(df, ...)` returns `df` with only the columns listed in `...`, one column or column-expression per argument

```{r}
#| echo: true
polyps %>% 
  select(participant_id:baseline, age)
```

## `select()` notes

-   Indicate ranges with **`:`** (colon)
    -   `age:baseline` is columns age through baseline (inclusive)
-   Numeric indices may be used instead of names
-   Columns in the result will follow whatever order you use with `select()`, i.e., you can rearrange at the same time that you select
-   A minus sign (**`-`**) prepended to a column name *negates* or *excludes* it ("all columns except x")

## `select()` example

```{r}
#| echo: true

# select cols participant_id thru treatment except age, and col. no. 7

polyps %>% 
  select(participant_id:treatment, -age, 7)
```

# Sorting rows in a data frame

## Sorting df rows with `dplyr::arrange()` {.smaller}

-   Often we want to sort our data frame by values in one or more columns, e.g., alphabetically by name, or (more realistically) by treatment group and by outcome variable
-   `arrange(df, ...)` returns `df` with the rows reordered according to arguments (which are variable names)

```{r}
#| echo: true
polyps %>% 
  arrange(baseline) %>% print(n=7)
```

## `arrange()` notes

-   The function `desc()` ("descending") can be wrapped around a variable to reverse it
-   You can combine sort-variables sequentially, by giving more arguments: `arrange(colA, colB)` will sort by `colA`, and then sort by `colB` after that (as a tie-breaker).
-   Each argument can be an expression if needed (column name will usually be good enough)

## `arrange()` example

```{r}
#| echo: true
polyps %>% 
  arrange(treatment, sex, desc(age))
```

# ICA 2.1: Pipes, selecting, and sorting

# Filtering (subsetting) rows {#filtering-subsetting-rows}

## Step 0: logical expressions {.smaller}

-   `logical` is one of R's basic data types, for representing `TRUE` and `FALSE`; expressions which produce a logical value are *logical expressions*
-   Fundamentally, `TRUE`/`FALSE` are needed for application if-else logic
-   Numeric comparators **`> >= == != <= <`** all produce logical results
-   There are also functions which return logical values (we'll see some later)
-   logical AKA Boolean or conditional

## Logical expression examples

```{r}
#| echo: true
t_final

t_final > 32
t_final > 35.84
t_final <= 35.82

t_final == 35.67  # equals
t_final != 35.67  # does not equal
```

## Filtering rows with `dplyr::filter()` {.smaller}

-   We often need to exclude certain rows from our data, or isolate only certain rows of interest, depending on values in the data: for example, only one gender, or exclude patients whose BMI is outside the range of study, etc.
-   `filter(df, logical_expr)` returns `df` but only with rows for which `logical_expr` evaluates as `TRUE`

```{r}
#| echo: true

polyps %>% 
  filter(age > 24)
```

## `filter()` notes {.smaller}

-   String comparison uses `==` or functions (e.g., "name contains X")
-   The expression may contain multiple variables/columns, but it is evaluated only once for each row in the source df
-   Combining multiple expressions:
    -   **`&`**, the AND operator $\rightarrow$ true iff both A and B are true
    -   **`|`**, the OR operator $\rightarrow$ true if A or B is true (or both)
    -   `xor()` is the exclusive OR $\rightarrow$ true iff A or B is true (but not both)
-   Any logical expression may be negated/reversed by prepending with **`!`**

## `filter()` example

```{r}
#| echo: true
# retain non-placebo patients aged 18 and older:

polyps %>% 
  filter(treatment != "placebo", age >= 18)
```

# Summarizing and grouping a data frame

## Base R `summary()` {.smaller}

-   `summary()` is a base R function that prints a summary of an object; the exact format depends on the object and data type
    -   numeric vector: five-number summary (very convenient!)
    -   factor, i.e. categorical vector: count of cases in each category
    -   dataframe: `summary()` of each column
-   Try out `summary()` on new objects as you come across them, in addition to printing them on the console.
-   `summary()` is very quick and easy, but its results aren't in a convenient format for further calculation/reporting. Its output is also fixed.

## Summarizing a data frame with `dplyr::summarize()` {.smaller}

-   Often we want to aggregate or simplify multiple rows of information into one row, e.g., mean of a variable for all observations.
-   `dplyr::summarize()` applies aggregating functions to variables and returns a data frame.

```{r}
#| echo: true
polyps %>% 
  summarize(mean(age), sd(age))
```

## `summarize()` notes {.smaller}

-   Aggregation functions
    -   center: `mean()`, `median()`
    -   spread: `sd()`, `IQR()`
    -   range: `min()`, `max()`
    -   position: `first()`, `last()`, `nth()`
    -   count: `n()`, `n_distinct()`
    -   logical: `any()`, `all()`
-   To name the columns in the output data frame, use named arguments.
-   Usually we will summarize after grouping (next section)

## `summarize()` example

```{r}
#| echo: true

# summarize the table's number of patients, 
# avg age, avg baseline, and max baseline:

polyps %>% 
  summarize(row_count = n(), 
            avg_age = round(mean(age), 1),
            avg_baseline = round(mean(baseline), 1),
            max_baseline = max(baseline))
```

## Grouping data frame rows with `dplyr::group_by()` {.smaller}

-   We often want to identify and examine subgroups within the data using categorical variables.
-   `group_by(df, variable)` returns a data frame with each row grouped according to its value for `variable`; this grouped df is then used with other dplyr functions (especially `summarize()`)

```{r}
#| echo: true
polyps %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>% print(n=7)
```

## `group_by()` notes

-   More than one grouping is possible (and sequence matters)
-   If you want to group e.g. by numeric ranges/bins, you'll first create a categorical variable using the numeric variable as a basis (we will do this in session 4 or 5)
-   Also compatible with other dplyr functions: `filter()`, `arrange()`, etc.

## `group_by()` example

```{r}
#| echo: true
# group by treatment and sex,
# then calculate avg baseline and avg 3-month polyp count

polyps %>% 
  group_by(treatment, sex) %>% 
  summarize(avg_baseline = round(mean(baseline), 1),
            avg_number3m = round(mean(number3m), 1))
```

# ICA 2.2: Filtering, summarizing, and grouping

# Base R plotting

## Easy base R plots {.smaller}

-   `hist(x)` gives a histogram for numeric vector x
-   `barplot(x)` produces a bar plot of categorical variable x
-   `plot(x, y)` produces a scatter plot of vectors x and y

```{r}
#| echo: true
hist(polyps$age)
```
