# Thinking about data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Thinking about data

Basic types of data:

- string or character-based data
  - may be optimized (rearranged, compressed) at the expense of
    human-readability
- image, audio, and video data

Ways to work with data:

- Tabular format
- Document format (XML)
- Computer vision and audition

In this course, we are working with string data‚Äîinterpreted as numeric
values and pieces of text‚Äîin a tabular format.

# What are R and RStudio? What can you do with them?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What are R and RStudio?

<div class="columns">

<div class="column" width="50%">

<img src="images/Rlogo.svg" data-fig-alt="R logo"
data-fig-align="center" height="90" />

**R** is‚Ä¶

- a tool for statistical analysis and visualization dating back to 1993
- a general-purpose programming language
- text-based command interface $\rightarrow$ it runs on the
  console/command line
- free, open-source software (FOSS) stewarded by the nonprofit,
  Vienna-based R Foundation

</div>

<div class="column" width="50%">

<img src="images/RStudio-Logo.svg" data-fig-alt="RStudio logo"
data-fig-align="center" height="100" />

**RStudio (Desktop)** is‚Ä¶

- an ‚Äúintegrated development environment‚Äù‚Äîgraphical interface with
  numerous features‚Äîfor analysis and programming in R and Python
- Posit (until recently, called RStudio) is a Boston-based public
  benefit corporation, founded 2009; makes both FOSS and commercial
  software and offers hosted services

</div>

</div>

## What can you do with R and RStudio?

<div class="columns">

<div class="column" width="40%">

- Import data from file and online sources
- Explore, clean, reformat, and combine data
- Perform calculations and analyses on data, especially using
  statistical methods
- Visualize data
- Present information in a variety of formats (documents, Web, etc.)
- Build a dashboard or other web app, especially interacting with
  tabular data

</div>

<div class="column" width="60%">

</div>

</div>

## Why I prefer R

<div class="columns">

<div class="column" width="50%">

**versus Excel:**

‚úÖ Non-proprietary, open source  
‚úÖ Powerful and fast interactions with data  
‚úÖ Very extensible  
‚úÖ Research-oriented community  
‚úÖ Reproducible and visible interactions with data  
‚úÖ Data viz makes sense to me  
‚úÖ Can handle more data for a given quantity of system resources  
‚úÖ Less prone to accidental user error

‚ùå R has a steeper learning curve  
‚ùå R/RStudio doesn‚Äôt have convenient data entry

</div>

<div class="column" width="50%">

**versus Python:**

‚úÖ Purpose-built for stats  
‚úÖ Simpler mental model and syntax (for tabular data work)  
‚úÖ RStudio is better than (free) IDEs for Python  
‚úÖ I can always call Python from within R if I need to

‚ùå R has a smaller (but more focused) community with less published code

</div>

</div>

# R as a calculator

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Our first R code

- When you open RStudio, you‚Äôll see the console. This is where R waits
  for commands.
- Arithmetic operators: **`+ - * / ^`** (exponentiation) `%%` (modulus)
  `%/%` (integer division)
- As in algebra, an R **function** accepts *arguments* and returns a
  *value*.
- Common mathematical functions:
  `sum(), mean(), median(), mode(), min(), max(), sd(), sqrt(), abs()`
- Logarithms: `log(x)` for natural and `log10(x)` for base 10 (or
  `log(x, base)`¬†for any base you want)
- $e$ (Euler‚Äôs number) is represented with `exp(1)`, where `1` is the
  desired exponent of $e$.
- Rounding: `round()` for decimal places, `signif()` for specifiying
  significant digits
  - See also: `floor()`, `ceiling()`
- NOTE: To operate on more than one value, such as calculating a mean,
  your values need to be inside a *vector*.

## Vectors in R

- An ordered collection of values, all having the same type (e.g.,
  numeric or text)
- Created with the **`c()`** function (‚Äúcombine‚Äù)
- R *loves* vectors‚Äîso much, that any single value you give to R, is
  returned as a 1-length vector!
- Very many operations are *vectorized*, meaning that they apply to
  every value in a vector by default.

# RStudio orientation

## What kinds of files will you use in RStudio? (1)

- **R Notebook** (**.Rmd**) or **Quarto document** (**.qmd**): mix
  formatted text and code and code outputs

- **R script** (**.R**): plain-text file that can be executed by R
  directly

  - ‚ö† The only permitted ‚Äúnatural language‚Äù is in code comments.

- [**R
  Project**](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects)
  (**.Rproj**): lives in the directory for a given project, and holds
  information like command history and settings. Optional but
  recommended.

- .**RData**: a workspace (session) snapshot

- **.rds**: an R data structure, i.e., an R object which has been saved
  to the filesystem

## What kinds of files will you use in RStudio? (2)

Of course, you will also be loading files in whatever format your data
take (spreadsheets, shapefiles, etc.).

Protip: make sure your operating system is set to display *all* file
extensions!

- [Windows
  instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/common-file-name-extensions-in-windows-da4a4430-8e76-89c5-59f7-1cdbbc75cb01)

## Ways to run your session

- Console: quick calculations, one-line pieces of code
- Scripts: multiple console commands saved in one file
  - You can send to console line-by-line, or entire file at once
- Notebooks: a document with ‚Äúcode chunks‚Äù (mini scripts)
  - You can run the chunk one line at a time, or entire chunk at once

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Working Directory (1)

- Suppose your project folder has a subfolder called `data`, and a file
  called `patients.csv`.
  - Absolute path:
    `/users/djb190/Documents/projects/R/study-x/data/patients.csv`
  - Relative path: `data/patients.csv`
- We would rather use the relative path, but R needs to know, ‚Äúrelative
  to where?‚Äù

## Working Directory (2)

- Use **`getwd()`** to check your current working directory
- To set your working directory:
  - In the **Files** tab (bottom right), click the three dots **‚Ä¶** at
    right, find the folder you would like to use as Working Directory,
    and click Open
  - Now click the **‚öôMore‚ñæ** button and choose **Set As Working
    Directory**
- When you run a <u>script</u>, you should set the working directory
- When you open a <u>notebook</u>, RStudio will automatically treat the
  notebook‚Äôs location as the working directory

# Packages

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Packages üì¶

- Packages are additional functionality created by individuals and
  collaborations in the R user community
- So far, we have only used **base R**
- Packages greatly extend R! You‚Äôll use them *all the time*.
- The authoritative place for packages is **CRAN**, the Comprehensive R
  Archive Network (<https://cran.r-project.org/>)
  - A convenient directory and repository
  - QA/QC process; trusted as reliable and safe

## Install a package

1.  Google ‚ÄúRstats $x$‚Äù where $x$ is whatever you want to do (or maybe
    ‚ÄúR package for $x$‚Äù). Read about available packages for your job and
    choose one.
2.  Go to Packages tab (bottom right pane ‚ñõ) and click Install.
3.  Type the name of the package you want and click install.

Or if you like to write code: `install.packages("name-of-package")`

Let‚Äôs install the **tidyverse**, a collection of packages that we‚Äôll use
for the rest of the course: **`install.packages("tidyverse")`**

## Attach a package

- To use a package, we need to *attach* it:
  - In Packages tab, click the checkbox next to the package name
  - or run `library(package-name)`
- Once a package is attached, its functions and/or datasets are
  available in the workspace. (But all packages are detached when the
  session ends.)
- Some packages will display a message or warning when they attach; some
  will not; depending on the package and your setup

Now let‚Äôs attach tidyverse: **`library(tidyverse)`**

# Loading data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tabular data

You are likely to encounter tabular data in the following storage
formats:

- Comma-separated values (**CSV**) or tab-separated values (TSV):
  `.csv, .tsv, .dat, .txt`
- Excel spreadsheets: `.xlsx, .xls`
- OpenDocument spreadsheet from OpenOffice/LibreOffice: `.ods`
- Parquet, a columnar format which is very efficient: `.parquet`
- Relational databases: usually via remote connection
  - Requires writing structured query language (SQL) or using a
    SQL-based package.

We are going to focus on CSV, since it is a non-proprietary and
extremely common format.

## Loading a CSV

<div class="columns">

<div class="column" width="67%">

- readr is a package for reading CSVs and other character-delimited
  formats
  - (also possible with base R, but readr is recommended)
- `library(readr)` will attach readr, but it is included in tidyverse
  (which we already have attached)
- This means we can call readr‚Äôs `read_csv()` function!
- You can also call a function from an installed package, without
  attaching it, by prepending the package name and two colons:
  `readr::read_csv()`.

</div>

<div class="column" width="33%">

<img src="images/readr-logo.png" data-fig-align="center" />

</div>

</div>

## Object assignment

In order to do something with our data, besides look at them once, we
need to tell R to *assign* the result of our expression‚Äîi.e., the output
of `read_csv()`‚Äîto an object. We also sometimes call this *storing* or
*saving*¬†an object

We use a left-pointing arrow, **`<-`** (type less-than and hyphen) for
assignment:

``` r
my_values <- c(1, 2, 3)
```

<div>

> **Keyboard shortcuts**

> <div class="columns">

> <div class="column" width="50%">
>
> Windows:
>
> **Alt -** (alt-hyphen) inserts an assignment operator, `<-`
>
> </div>
>
> <div class="column" width="50%">
>
> Mac:
>
> **‚å• -** (option-hyphen) inserts an assignment operator, `<-`
>
> </div>
>
> </div>

</div>

You may also use **`=`** (equals) for object assignment, although it is
not recommended.

``` r
my_values = c(1, 2, 3)
```

## Viewing the data

Use the **`View()`** function on our loaded data to launch the Data
Viewer, for example: **`View(my_values)`**.

You can also type the object‚Äôs name to see a brief textual
representation of it, in the console or notebook.

# ICA 1.1: console calculations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# R data types and structures

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data types

Every value in R has one of these types:

- `numeric`: real, decimal numbers
- `integer`: whole numbers
- `character`: text; should always be in quotation marks `" "` in code
- `logical`: `TRUE` and `FALSE`, also called Boolean
- `complex`: for imaginary values i.e.¬†complex numbers (rare)
- `raw`: values are stored as bytes and not human-readable (rare)

## Data structures

Multiple values are organized into structures. These are the most common
structures:

- **Vector**: we have already used this ordered collection of single
  type; R‚Äôs default structure; 1D
- **List**: ordered collection of varying types; 1D
- **Data frame**: a tabular structure; 2D
  - ‚Äútable‚Äù and ‚Äúdata.table‚Äù are two alternatives to data frames with
    different use cases
- Matrix (2D), Array ($n$D): Used for linear algebra (under-the-hood
  statistics)
- A special vector is the **factor**, which allows only certain values
  (defined in the structure); used for categorical variables
- Many other specialized structures are offered by packages, built upon
  these components

## The data frame

- A table in which each column (‚Äúvariable‚Äù) is a vector of equal length
- Row $n$ (or ‚Äúcase‚Äù or ‚Äúobservation‚Äù $n$ ) is read by retrieving the
  $n$th value of each variable
- To reference a variable/column, use the format `data_frame$var_name`
- We‚Äôll be spending the rest of our time in this course with data frames
  and vectors.
- (Under the hood, a data frame is a list with some added features.)

# Saving data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Writing a CSV

- readr can also write: **`write_csv()`**
- Remember Working Directory and relative paths.
- The file name must be in quotation marks, e.g.,
  **`write_csv("patients.csv")`**

The data frame is the ‚ÄúR-native‚Äù representation of the data. We read and
write to an interchange format (CSV) to save and/or share our work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Wrap up

## Conclusion

- Orienting to R and RStudio
- Performing basic calculations and function calls
- Opening, viewing, and saving data
- Writing our first R code üòé
